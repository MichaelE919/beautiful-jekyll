This is intended to be a collection of some personal projects Iâ€™ve started working on. Everything is published on [Github](https://github.com/MichaelE919).

## Python
* [ncaa-stats-webscraper](https://github.com/MichaelE919/ncaa-stats-webscraper) - This Python script uses the Request and Beautiful Soup libraries to collect team stats from teamrankings.com and kenpom.com and creates a series of lists and dictionaries to contain the information. With the help of the Pandas and Openpyxl libraries, the various team stats are written to a preformatted Excel spreadsheet.

## Machine Learning
* [kaggle-ncaa-ml-2018-mens](https://github.com/MichaelE919/kaggle-ncaa-ml-2018-mens) - This is the code I wrote and used to enter a submission into [Kaggle's 2018 Men's NCAA Machine Learning competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/mens-machine-learning-competition-2018).
* [machine-learning-predict-weather](https://github.com/MichaelE919/machine-learning-predict-weather) - This is a machine learning project I took on after reading a three-part article on stackabuse.com. Who am I kidding, the point of this was not to predict weather. I live in Texas- it's always hot! The real point of this was to learn more about linear regression and Scikit-Learn. I've got a good working model- now I just have to test it against real weather data. Again, the real goal is not to predict weather, but to practice developing a machine learning model and to refine and revise it to make it better.

## Coming soon!
* A sentiment analysis of some kind - I've read about a few of these and it sounds really cool.
* A deep learning project. Right now, these are all just a bunch of voodoo magic. I need to find a project that's easy enough to help me learn but is also something that I can use to fix some actual problem or question.
