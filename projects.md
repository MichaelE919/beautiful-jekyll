This is intended to be a collection of some personal projects Iâ€™ve started working on. Everything is published on [Github](https://github.com/MichaelE919).

## Python
* [ncaa-stats-webscraper](https://github.com/MichaelE919/ncaa-stats-webscraper) - This Python script uses the Request and Beautiful Soup libraries to collect team stats from teamrankings.com and kenpom.com and creates a series of lists and dictionaries to contain the information. With the help of the Pandas and Openpyxl libraries, the various team stats are written to a preformatted Excel spreadsheet.

## Machine Learning
* [kaggle-ncaa-ml-2018-mens](https://github.com/MichaelE919/kaggle-ncaa-ml-2018-mens) - This is the code I wrote and used to enter a submission into [Kaggle's 2018 Men's NCAA Machine Learning competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/mens-machine-learning-competition-2018).

## Coming soon!
* machine-learning-predict-weather - Using machine learning to predict the local weather in Round Rock Texas.
* A sentiment analysis of some kind - I've read about a few of these and it sounds really cool.
