My name is Michael Eichenberger, married to Karly for 11 years. Father to Emma, who is 5, and Kayla, who is 2. We also have a Miniature Dachshund named Hans. Actually, his full name is Hansen Franzen von Liechtenstein. We sometimes call him Hansie. On the topic of nicknames, we sometimes call Kayla "Keka," which is what she calls herself. I've called Emma "Baby" ever since she was one, although I think she is now tired of it.

We live in Round Rock, Texas, 20 miles north of the state's capital, Austin. Karly and I are both from California. I was born and raised in San Jose. We moved to Texas 6 months after getting married.

I work at the Teacher Retirement System of Texas as a Business Analyst. Before that, I was play and art teacher at Gymboree. I've had jobs in fast food and retail, and for several years, I taught private piano lessons to young children.

I have a Bachelor of Arts degree in Music from California State University, Hayward (now named California State University, East Bay) and a Master of Arts degree in Music History from San Francisco State University.

My hobbies and interests shift from time to time, but right now, I'm really into coding. Or trying to learn anyway. I've introduced myself to a lot of different languages, from HTML, Javascript, Python, Ruby, and SQL. I'm focusing on Python and Ruby at the moment (because they're relatively easy), but something tells me I will have to learn just about all of them. I also like to read about ethical hacking and Docker containers. (That last one is pretty, cool. Check it out [here](https://www.docker.com/).)

I don't have much to show for it, but as I come up with more and more stuff, I'll add it to my Projects page.
