My name is Michael Eichenberger, married to Karly for 12 years. Father to Emma, who is 6, and Kayla, who is 3. We also have two dogs: a Dachshund named Hans and a Lab/Great Dane mix name Dude. Actually, Hans' full name is Hans N Franz von Liechtenstein. We sometimes call him Hansie. Dude's name is Dude because we couldn't think of anything else to call him. (And he looks like a Dude.) On the topic of nicknames, we sometimes call Kayla "Keka," which is what she calls herself. I've called Emma "Baby" ever since she was one, although I think she is now tired of it. (Edit- I rarely call her that anymore.)

We live in Round Rock, Texas, 20 miles north of the state's capital, Austin. Karly and I are both from California. I was born and raised in San Jose. We moved to Texas 6 months after getting married.

I work at the Teacher Retirement System of Texas as a Business Analyst. Before that, I was play and art teacher at Gymboree. I've had jobs in fast food and retail, and for several years, I taught private piano lessons to young children.

I have a Bachelor of Arts degree in Music from California State University, Hayward (now named California State University, East Bay) and a Master of Arts degree in Music History from San Francisco State University.

My hobbies and interests shift from time to time, but right now, I'm really into coding, specifically data science and machine learning with Python. I've introduced myself to a lot of different languages, from HTML, Javascript, Python, Ruby, and SQL, but right now, it's just Python. It is a very flexible language and you can do just about anything with it. The data science stack of the Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-Learn libraries are simply amazing!

In addition to my blog, I'll also show various projects I'm working on. I come up with more and more stuff, I'll add it to my [Projects](https://michaele919.github.io/projects) page.
