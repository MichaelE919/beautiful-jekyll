This is my first post, how exciting! Actually no, that's not true. About nine years ago, I started blogging about stuff, mostly politics. Truthfully, was only about politics. I was really passionate about that back then. Nine years later, I still believe what I believe, I'm just not as passionate about that I want to spend time rambling about it.

I'm moving on with my life.

I'm learning something else to be passionate about and ramble on about.

That something else is [Python](python.org) and all things [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning). That's what this *new* blog is going to be about. This blog will chronical my path into machine learning. I've been working through a few tutorials but now it's time to grab hold of a few projects to call my own and actually make a difference.

Okay, that's a little dramatic. But I will take on machine learning projects with practical applications and build a portfolio of work. Maybe this will a simple hobby of mine. Who knows, it could always lead to more.

Follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MichaelE919) and [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/michael-eichenberger). Check out my [projects](https://michaele919.github.io/projects) page and see how I do. Of course, all my code will published on [Github](https://github.com/MichaelE919). Oh, and every now and then I'll blog about topics other than Python and machine learning, such as my awesome dance moves, what my kids are up to, or whatever else may be going on in my life. Thanks for reading!

Don't mind me, I'm just rambling.
